## Local Testing

The preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker. You will have to install Docker on your system.

You can also use vagrant and Virtualbox with vagrant to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your system. For all our tests we use test-kitchen.

Next install test-kitchen:

```shell
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Testing with Docker

```shell
# List all tests with kitchen
kitchen list

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test mariadb-103-centos-7

# test on all machines
kitchen test

# for development, create environment
kitchen create default-centos-7

# Apply ansible playbook
kitchen converge default-centos-7

# Apply inspec tests
kitchen verify default-centos-7
```

### Testing with Virtualbox

```shell
# Specify kitchen file on Linux
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-vagrant.yml

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test os-packaging-freebsd-11
```

### Testing Windows or Solaris with Virtualbox

Windows can only be test with Virtualbox provider,do not use 'kitchen test' command for testing Windows environment. There 4 major commands you will be using with test-kitchen as part of your workflow.

First of all we must set the kitchen file:
```shell
# For testing Windows
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-windows.yml

# For testing Solaris
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-solaris.yml
```

Provision the virtual machines, a Linux machine to run Ansible and Windows machines to apply playbook against:
```shell
# deploy machines
kitchen create

# Apply playbook
kitchen converge
```

Finaly launch inspec tests:
```shell
kitchen verify
```

For cleaning environment use:
```shell
kitchen destroy
```
